# Editor
Trying to make a 'mini' vim like editor in rust. Currently a work in progress.

# Test Branch
This branch will feature adding a vim like command buffer

# Warning 
Saves files with "/n/r" instead of "/n"

## Todo
* improve word jumps, add f/F/t/T
* improve commands command
* add file tree explore page when no file added
* fix all todos and fixes in proj
* add actions, like delete, to motions
* later implement ptr_x for longer lines
