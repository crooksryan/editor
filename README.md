# Editor
Trying to make a 'mini' vim like editor in rust. Currently a work in progress.

# Test
This file was written in the editor.

### Current State
Currently working on add Vim motions and a command buffer.

### Warning
Performs better on Linux than Windows. Windows has performance issues when rendering and cursor movement.
